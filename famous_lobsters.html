        <h2><span>Lobster Thermidor</span></h2>
        <p><span>The extravagant lobster Thermidor is a classic French dish. Made with lobster meat which is sautéed in wine or cognac, and mixed with a creamy egg-based sauce and cheese, the dish is assembled and baked in whole lobster tails. Numerous stories and legends surround the dish, but the most probable version is that it is named after the play known as Thermidor, set in Paris in January.</span></p>
        <p><span>According to this theory, the dish was invented at Marie’s, a famous restaurant at the time, on the night of Thermidor's premiere. Even though the play did not gain success, the dish was a crowd-pleaser. It uses all of the traditional French ingredients such as butter and cream, which produce a lavish dish when combined with lobster.</span></p>
