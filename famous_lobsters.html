        <h2><span>Thermidor</span></h2>
        <p><span>The extravagant lobster Thermidor is a classic French dish. Made with lobster meat which is sautéed in wine or cognac, and mixed with a creamy egg-based sauce and cheese, the dish is assembled and baked in whole lobster tails. Numerous stories and legends surround the dish, but the most probable version is that it is named after the play known as Thermidor, set in Paris in January.</span></p>
        <p><span>According to this theory, the dish was invented at Marie’s, a famous restaurant at the time, on the night of Thermidor's premiere. Even though the play did not gain success, the dish was a crowd-pleaser. It uses all of the traditional French ingredients such as butter and cream, which produce a lavish dish when combined with lobster.</span></p>

        <h2><span>Roll</span></h2>
        <p><span>Lobster roll is a Maine specialty consisting of cooked lobster meat that is, ideally, drizzled with melted butter and placed into long hot dog rolls. Additionally, the sandwich might include lettuce, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Traditional accompaniments include potato chips or french fries on the side.</span></p>
        <p><span>Some claim that lobster roll first appeared at Perry's in Milford, Connecticut, while others claim it was first prepared at Red's in Wiscasset, Maine. Regardless of the origins, the entire state of Maine continues to honor the tradition by offering more version of lobster rolls than the first inventor could have possibly imagined, starting an endless debate over how it should be made and who makes the best rolls. </span></p>
